             * Create a new order.## Placing Orders
             *
             * This endpoint is used for placing orders. See individual fields below for more details on their use.
             *
             * #### Order Types
             *
             * All orders require a `symbol`. All other fields are optional except when otherwise specified.
             *
             * These are the valid `ordType`s:
             *
             * - **Limit**: The default order type. Specify an `orderQty` and `price`.
             * - **Market**: A traditional Market order. A Market order will execute until filled or your bankruptcy price is reached, at
             * which point it will cancel.
             * - **Stop**: A Stop Market order. Specify an `orderQty` and `stopPx`. When the `stopPx` is reached, the order will be entered
             * into the book.
             * - On sell orders, the order will trigger if the triggering price is lower than the `stopPx`. On buys, higher.
             * - Note: Stop orders do not consume margin until triggered. Be sure that the required margin is available in your
             * account so that it may trigger fully.
             * - `Close` Stops don't require an `orderQty`. See Execution Instructions below.
             * - **StopLimit**: Like a Stop Market, but enters a Limit order instead of a Market order. Specify an `orderQty`, `stopPx`,
             * and `price`.
             * - **MarketIfTouched**: Similar to a Stop, but triggers are done in the opposite direction. Useful for Take Profit orders.
             * - **LimitIfTouched**: As above; use for Take Profit Limit orders.
             * - **Pegged**: Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price. Specify a
             * `pegPriceType`, and `pegOffsetValue`.
             * - Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time the order
             * is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.
             * - `PrimaryPeg`: Price is set relative to near touch price.
             * - `MarketPeg`: Price is set relative to far touch price.
             * - A `pegPriceType` submitted with no `ordType` is treated as a `Pegged` order.
             *
             * #### Execution Instructions
             *
             * The following `execInst`s are supported. If using multiple, separate with a comma (e.g. `LastPrice,Close`).
             *
             * - **ParticipateDoNotInitiate**: Also known as a Post-Only order. If this order would have executed on placement, it will cancel instead.
             * This is intended to protect you from the far touch moving towards you while the order is in transit.
             * It is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.
             * - **MarkPrice, LastPrice, IndexPrice**: Used by stop and if-touched orders to determine the triggering price.
             * Use only one. By default, `MarkPrice` is used. Also used for Pegged orders to define the value of `LastPeg`. IndexPrice is not applicable to spot trading symbols.
             * - **ReduceOnly**: A `ReduceOnly` order can only reduce your position, not increase it. If you have a `ReduceOnly`
             * limit order that rests in the order book while the position is reduced by other orders, then its order quantity will
             * be amended down or canceled. If there are multiple `ReduceOnly` orders the least aggressive will be amended first. Not applicable to spot trading symbols.
             * - **Close**: `Close` implies `ReduceOnly`. A `Close` order will cancel other active limit orders with the same side
             * and symbol if the open quantity exceeds the current position. This is useful for stops: by canceling these orders, a
             * `Close` Stop is ensured to have the margin required to execute, and can only execute up to the full size of your
             * position. If `orderQty` is not specified, a `Close` order has an `orderQty` equal to your current position's size. Not applicable to spot trading symbols.
             * - Note that a `Close` order without an `orderQty` requires a `side`, so that BitMEX knows if it should trigger
             * above or below the `stopPx`.
             * - **LastWithinMark**: Used by stop orders with `LastPrice` to allow stop triggers only when:
             * - For Sell Stop Market / Stop Limit Order
             * - Last Price &lt= Stop Price
             * - Last Price &gt= Mark Price × (1 - 5%)
             * - For Buy Stop Market / Stop Limit Order:
             * - Last Price &gt= Stop Price
             * - Last Price &lt= Mark Price × (1 + 5%)
             * - Not applicable to spot trading symbols.
             * - **Fixed**: Pegged orders **must** have an `execInst` of `Fixed`. This means the limit price is set at the time
             * the order is accepted and does not change as the reference price changes.
             *
             * #### Pegged Orders
             *
             * Pegged orders allow users to submit a limit price relative to the current market price.
             * The limit price is set once when the order is submitted and does not change with the reference price.
             * This order type is not intended for speculating on the far touch moving away after submission - we consider such behaviour abusive and monitor for it.
             *
             * Pegged orders have an `ordType` of `Pegged`, and an `execInst` of `Fixed`.
             *
             * A `pegPriceType` and `pegOffsetValue` must also be submitted:
             *
             * - `PrimaryPeg` - price is set relative to the **near touch** price
             * - `MarketPeg` - price is set relative to the **far touch** price
             *
             * #### Trailing Stop Pegged Orders
             *
             * Use `pegPriceType` of `TrailingStopPeg` to create Trailing Stops.
             *
             * The price is set at submission and updates once per second if the underlying price (last/mark/index) has moved by
             * more than 0.1%. `stopPx` then moves as the market moves away from the peg, and freezes as the market moves toward it.
             *
             * Use `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price specified in the
             * `execInst` (default `MarkPrice`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.
             *
             * Requires `ordType`: `Stop`, `StopLimit`, `MarketIfTouched`, `LimitIfTouched`.
             *
             * #### Linked Orders
             *
             * Linked Orders are an advanced capability. It is very powerful, but its use requires careful coding and testing.
             * Please follow this document carefully and use the [Testnet Exchange](https://testnet.bitmex.com) while developing.
             *
             * BitMEX offers four advanced Linked Order types:
             *
             * - **OCO**: _One Cancels the Other_. A very flexible version of the standard Stop / Take Profit technique.
             * Multiple orders may be linked together using a single `clOrdLinkID`. Send a `contingencyType` of
             * `OneCancelsTheOther` on the orders. The first order that fully or partially executes (or activates
             * for `Stop` orders) will cancel all other orders with the same `clOrdLinkID`.
             * - **OTO**: _One Triggers the Other_. Send a `contingencyType` of `'OneTriggersTheOther'` on the primary order and
             * then subsequent orders with the same `clOrdLinkID` will be not be triggered until the primary order fully executes.
             *
             * #### Trailing Stops
             *
             * You may use `pegPriceType` of `'TrailingStopPeg'` to create Trailing Stops. The pegged `stopPx` will move as the market
             * moves away from the peg, and freeze as the market moves toward it.
             *
             * To use, combine with `pegOffsetValue` to set the `stopPx` of your order. The peg is set to the triggering price
             * specified in the `execInst` (default `'MarkPrice'`). Use a negative offset for stop-sell and buy-if-touched orders.
             *
             * Requires `ordType`: `'Stop', 'StopLimit', 'MarketIfTouched', 'LimitIfTouched'`.
             *
             * #### Simple Quantities
             *
             * [Simple Quantities are deprecated as of 2018/10/26](https://blog.bitmex.com/api_announcement/deprecation-of-simpleorderqty-functionality/)
             *
             * #### Rate Limits
             *
             * You can improve your reactivity to market movements while staying under your rate limit by using the
             * [Amend](#!/Order/Order_amend) endpoint (PUT /order). This allows you to stay
             * in the market and avoids the cancel/replace cycle.
             *
             * #### Tracking Your Orders
             *
             * If you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique `clOrdID` per order.
             * This `clOrdID` will come back as a property on the order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket),
             * and can be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.
             *
             * You can also change the `clOrdID` by amending an order, supplying an `origClOrdID`, and your desired new
             * ID as the `clOrdID` param, like so:
             *
             * ```
             * # Amends an order's leavesQty, and updates its clOrdID to "def-456"
             * PUT /api/v1/order {"origClOrdID": "abc-123", "clOrdID": "def-456", "leavesQty": 1000}
             * ```
             */

             *

             * ### Internal Transfers
             *

             * Note that `/api/v1/user/walletTransfer` may be a more suitable endpoint for transfers between linked accounts.
             *
             * ### Saved Address Verification
             *
             * Please note that when using saved addresses, `skip2FA` and `skipConfirm` require verification:
             * - `skip2FA` can be verified by providing `otpToken` when creating the address. If `otpToken` is not provided, a 2FA code can be provided by visiting the link included in the email sent upon address creation.
             *
             * - `skipConfirm` can be verified by visiting the link included in the email sent upon address creation.
             *
             * ### Whitelist
             *
             * If the address book has the `whitelist` setting enabled, all withdrawal requests must be directed to either a saved addresses or a linked account. All other addresses will be rejected. Note that saved addresses must be __active__. A new saved address is active if it has been 2FA verified and a cooldown period has passed since its creation.
